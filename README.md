)

Key Concepts Mastered: Evolution from legacy on-premises infrastructure to cloud models; analysis of Cloud Deployment Models (Public, Private, Hybrid); differentiation of Cloud Service Layers (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and their operational trade-offs.

Applied Competencies: Articulated business-driven cloud adoption rationales (agility, elastic scalability, OpEx reduction) and evaluated service abstraction levels for optimal solution design.

Project Integration (BUSI Project 1): Justified the selection of AWS Glue (PaaS) and Athena (SaaS) over IaaS alternatives, eliminating server management overhead. This enabled focus on ETL logic and business insights, directly leveraging managed services’ inherent scalability and maintenance benefits.

## Applied Competencies:
Migrated from on-premises Hadoop cluster to hybrid cloud (sensitive data in VPC, public datasets in S3). Adopted:

PaaS: AWS Glue for ETL

SaaS: Athena for ad-hoc analytics

Project Impact: 40% faster dataset onboarding
